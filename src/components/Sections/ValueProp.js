            Our goal is less travel, less waste, and more freshness. Typically,
            large amounts of food is wasted in distribution, warehousing, and
            merchandising. We believe in delivering straight from our farm to
            your family's kitchen, reducing enormous food waste. Being located
            close to home means less fuel and generating fewer greenhouse gases.
            On average, locally grown fresh food is generally healthier, more
            nutritious, and better-tasting due to reduced transit times. Food
            imported from afar is older and waits in distribution facilities for
            a long time before reaching your grocery store. The more steps
            between you and the source of your food, the greater the risk of
            contamination. Food cultivated in distant locationsÂ may pose food
            safety concerns during harvesting, washing, transportation, and
            distribution. At Innovative Agriproducts, we ensure our food is
            grown safely and without the use of pesticides or herbicides.
